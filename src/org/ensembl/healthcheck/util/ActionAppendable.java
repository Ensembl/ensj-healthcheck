/**
 * <p>
 * 	Class for capturing output from a subprocess and using this output elsewhere.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	Data can be written to this object by using the Appendable interface it 
 * implements. What is done with the data can be detemined by overwriting the
 * process method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	This class can be used whenever it is necessary to pass on an Appendable 
 * object to capture input. Usually StringBuffers are used for this. When using
 * a StringBuffer one has to wait for the process to return in order to process
 * what has been written to it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	By using this object one can immediately have anything written to the 
 * Appendable object forwarded to some other part of the program, for 
 * example to  display it. Overwrite the process method to decide what should 
 * be done with any output.
