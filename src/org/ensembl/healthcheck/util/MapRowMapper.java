/**
 * Used to provide a different form of {@link ResultSet} to domain object
 * mapping. As a pose to {@link RowMapper} which assumes that each row of a
 * result set is a unique domain object, this Object assumes that each domain
 * object defines a unique instance of which the backing query can return more
 * than one row & we need to aggregate this data together.
 *
 * <p>
 * One important difference is the usage of
 * {@link RowMapper#mapRow(ResultSet, int)} in this interface which is fired
 * ONLY when there is a new object. This happens when
 * {@link #getKey(ResultSet)} returns a key which
 * {@link Map#containsKey(Object)} returns false & therefore must be a new
 * entry.
